1. The OMNI data are a collection of measurements of the solar wind recorded near the L1 Lagrange point and propagated to Earth's bow shock nose
2. The OMNI data may be unreliable under certain conditions in the solar wind

We attempt to quantify the uncertainty (or determine the reliability) of OMNI in propagating the solar wind under the two strongest drivers of geomagnetic storms - High Speed Streams (HSSs) and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)
